# GMS-LudumDare47-AnHourLongMinute
 My Compo Entry for the 47th Ludum Dare, titled An Hour Long Minute, which I made using Game Maker Studio 1. A little late, but I feel good putting this source code up now, especially as I have made a post-mortem on this entry previously, which I plan to continue pursuing for other things soon.
